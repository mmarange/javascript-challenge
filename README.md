# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Basic search task - UFO level 1

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* A basic HTML web page using the provided [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file was built on.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, a code was written that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


* A date form in the HTML document was used to write JavaScript code that listened for `onchange` events and searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that matched the user input.

## Advanced search task - UFO level 2

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Building on level 1, JavaScript code was written  for multiple `input` tags, that a user  can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
